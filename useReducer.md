# useReducer

  Provides an alternative to **‘useState’** for managing complex state logic involving multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

                                          or 

## useReducer Hook Explained:- 
                     The useReducer hook, introduced alongside other hooks in React 16.8, provides a mechanism for managing complex state logic within functional components. 
                     It's particularly useful when you have:

                     1. **Multiple State Values**: If your component deals with several interconnected state values, 
                        useReducer helps keep the state updates organized and predictable.
                     2. **Complex State Updates**: When updating your component's state depends on the previous state,
                        useReducer offers a clear way to define the state transition logic.
                     
## Breakdown of useReducer:
    **useReducer** accepts two arguments (Reducer Function & Initial State) :
                
               1.  Reducer Function: This function is the heart of useReducer. 
                    It takes two arguments: 
                    the **current state (state)** and an **action object (action)**. 
                  Its responsibility is to return the new state based on the action type and payload (if present) within the action object.
                  Here's the basic structure:
                  
                const reducerFunction = (state, action) => {
                                switch (action.type) {
                                  case 'INCREMENT':
                                    return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
                                  case 'DECREMENT':
                                    return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
                                  default:
                                    return state;
                                }
                              };

            2.   Initial State: This argument specifies the initial state object that your component's
                    state will start with. It can be a simple value or  a more complex object structure.
                 
                 Return Values:
                        useReducer returns an array containing two elements:
                              Current State: This reflects the current value of the component's 
                                state based on the reducer function and dispatched actions.
                              Dispatch Function: This function is used to trigger state updates. 
                              You call dispatch with an action object  that tells the reducer how to update the state.

              Example: Counter with useReducer
                Here's a basic example demonstrating useReducer for managing a counter:

                                                          
                                                          import React, { useReducer } from 'react';
                                                          
                                                          const initialState = { count: 0 };
                                                          
                                                          const reducer = (state, action) => {
                                                            switch (action.type) {
                                                              case 'INCREMENT':
                                                                return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
                                                              case 'DECREMENT':
                                                                return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
                                                              default:
                                                                return state;
                                                            }
                                                          };
                                                          
                                                          function Counter() {
                                                            const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
                                                          
                                                            const increment = () => {
                                                              dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
                                                            };
                                                          
                                                            const decrement = () => {
                                                              dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
                                                            };
                                                          
                                                            return (
                                                              <div>
                                                                <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
                                                                <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
                                                                <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
                                                              </div>
                                                            );
                                                          }



                            
Use code with caution.
In this example:

The reducer function handles state updates based on the action type ('INCREMENT' or 'DECREMENT').
The Counter component uses useReducer to get the current state (state) and the dispatch function.
The increment and decrement functions dispatch actions to trigger state updates.
Additional Considerations:

Custom Hooks: You can create custom hooks using useReducer to encapsulate reusable state logic for more complex scenarios.
Comparison to useState: While useState is suitable for simpler state management, useReducer becomes valuable when dealing 
with complex state updates or multiple interconnected state values.
By effectively leveraging useReducer, you can enhance the organization, maintainability, and predictability 
 of state management in your React functional components.
